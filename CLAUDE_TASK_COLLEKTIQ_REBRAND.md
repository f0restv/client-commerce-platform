# Task: CollektIQ - Apple-style Minimal Rebrand

## Design Philosophy
Think Apple. Less is more. Premium feel through simplicity, whitespace, and typography.

## Homepage - ONE clear message

### Hero (full viewport height)
- Clean white/off-white background
- Large, elegant typography
- Headline: "Know what it's worth."
- Single line subtext: "Scan any coin. Get instant pricing."
- ONE button: "Start Scanning" → /scan
- Maybe a subtle, beautiful coin image or abstract gradient

### That's almost it.
- Maybe ONE more section below fold showing 3 simple icons with 5 words each max
- No feature dumps, no pricing tables on homepage, no testimonials

## Visual Style
- Lots of whitespace
- San Francisco / Inter font, clean weights
- Muted color palette - off-white, soft grays, ONE accent color (subtle blue or green)
- No gradients unless very subtle
- No shadows, no cards with borders
- Photography: high-quality coin macro shots IF used, otherwise abstract

## Navigation
- Logo: "CollektIQ" in clean sans-serif, no icon needed
- Links: Scan, Pricing, Sign In
- That's it

## Footer
- Minimal: © 2025 CollektIQ · Privacy · Terms
- Maybe small social icons

## Files to change
1. src/app/page.tsx - complete rewrite, minimal
2. src/components/layout/Header.tsx - strip down
3. src/components/layout/Footer.tsx - minimal
4. src/app/layout.tsx - update metadata
5. globals.css if needed for typography

## Remove
- Metal price ticker
- Product grids
- "How it works" steps
- Feature cards
- All CoinVault branding
- Amber/gold colors
- Busy layouts

## The vibe
Someone lands on the page, immediately understands what it does, feels like a premium product, clicks the ONE button.
